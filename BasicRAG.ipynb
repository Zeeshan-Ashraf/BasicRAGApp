He ruled an \\nEmpire that was one of the largest in the history of the world. It covered today’s Afghanistan, \\nPakistan, Iran, India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. The size of the huge Empire was easily \\ncomparable to the gig antic Roman Empire and British Empire. The rule of Emperor Shah Jahan was \\none of the most peaceful, prosperous and progressive times of Indian history. There were \\nunimaginable developments in the field of art and architecture. The peacock throne, the Taj M ahal, \\nthe Agra Fort and many other pieces of art and architecture that keep people mesmerized even today \\nwere built up during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan. Financial collections rose to the highest \\nvolume during this period. There were no major rebellio ns or political invasions during the reign of \\nEmperor Shah Jahan. \\nKeywords: Greatest, Prosperous, Progressive, Architecture, Indian History, Peacock Throne \\nIntroduction \\nShah Jahan was tolerant but not very liberal. He ordered the demolition of many Hindu temples and \\nChristian churches in Lahore, Delhi and Calcutta (today known as Kolkata). He had almost soured the \\nrelations with the Jain community in Gujarat who incidenta lly were the royal financiers of that era. It \\nis true that financial collections rose to a huge amount, in fact, to the highest level in the Mughal era. \\nBut that was not necessarily due to the growth in trade, commerce and business. It was because tax \\nrates were very high and the tax collectors were merciless while collecting tax from the common \\npeople. This gave rise to dissatisfaction and frustration in the minds of the common people against \\nthe Empire and the Emperor.Building of some of the most amazing pieces of art and architecture, \\nparticularly the Taj Mahal in Agra, made Shah Jahan immortal in not only Indian history, but in the \\nhistory of the world. But it also exhausted huge amounts of funds from the royal treasury. As a result \\nof this, there was a very serious fiscal recession immediately after the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan. \\nHe was so much absorbed in his lavish extravagant lifestyle that he had stopped looking into the \\naffairs of the Empire. He lost interest in the day to day matters of his Empir e. Slowly and gradually \\nthat had a devastating impact. Some of the important machineries for running the Empire, like the \\narmy and the royal executive became inefficient and ineffective. They were greedy and always \\nthinking of squeezing the Empire for thei r personal benefits. The army became so weak that at one'),\n",

On collection of data, analysis and \\ninterpretations of the data, the conclusions that were reache d were that there was tremendous \\ndevelopment in the field of art and architecture during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan, but all round \\ndevelopment was not achieved. Shah Jahan as an Emperor was busy with his extravagant lifestyle. He \\nwas ignorant about th e Empire and his subjects.

There was a kingdom in \\nRajasthan called Mewar. Mewar was hostile towards the Mughal dominance since the time of Akbar, \\nthe great. At the age of twenty two, Shah Jahan led an army of almost 200,0 00 and after a horrible \\nwar that extended for a year, he conquered Mewar. The then ruler of Mewar, Maharana Amar Singh II \\nsurrendered to him and thus, Mewar became a friendly kingdom for the first time in history of the \\nMughal Empire. In 1617, Shah Jahan f ought against the Lodis in the Deccan region and established \\nthe control of the Mughal Empire in that region. It made the then ruler at Delhi, his father Emperor \\nJahangir, so happy that he offered the prince a special seat in his court. This solidified Sha h Jahan’s \\nreach towards the throne. In this context, famous historian Edward S. Holden (5 November, 1846 – \\n16 March, 1914) wrote “He was flattered by some, envied by others, loved by none.”  \\nPatron of Art and Architecture: \\nShah Jahan is particularly remembe red in world history for being a patron of art and architecture. He \\nbuilt up his urban capital at Agra which according to many historians became envy for Instanbul (at \\npresent in Turkey) and Isfahan (at present in Iran), which were the two most important c ities in the \\nworld at that period. He commissioned the famous Peacock Throne or Mayur Singhasana. The \\nmagnificence of his court was appreciated by many European travellers like Bernier (1625 – 1688) \\nand Sir Thomas Roe (1581 – 1644). Many prefer to call his  reign the golden era of architecture. \\nAmong Shah Jahan’s constructions the most notable ones are – \\n\\uf0b7 Taj Mahal and Moti Masjid in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. \\n\\uf0b7 Red Fort and Jama Masjid in Delhi, India. \\n\\uf0b7 Shalimar Garden, Sheesh Mahal, Naulakha pavilion, Tomb of  Jahangir, Wazir Khan mosque and \\nparts of Lahore Fort in Lahore, at present in Western Punjab, Pakistan.  \\n\\uf0b7 Mahabat Khan Mosque in Peshawar, at present in North West Frontier province, Paksitan.  \\n\\uf0b7 Shah Jahan Mosque in Sindh, at present in Pakistan.    \\nFinance and Administration \\nHistorical evidences tell us that royalty collection rose to the highest level in the history of the \\nMughal Empire in India during the reign of Shah Jahan. There were no major rebellions or disruptive \\nforces that took birth in this period. The reign of Sha h Jahan was one of the most peaceful periods in \\nIndian history.  \\nContribution to Mughal Architecture \\nShah Jahan was an avid builder and is responsible for building some of the most beautiful edifices \\nin present day India and Pakistan. It is said that many European travelers would visit his empire'),\n",

It is also said that some \\nof the world’s most talented engineers and architects resided in his empire .  \\nConstruction of The Taj Mahal \\nOne of the most significant incidents in the life of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was the construction \\nof Taj Mahal. His beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal died while giving birth to their fourteenth child and \\nthe reason behind her death was stated to be postpartum ha emorrhage. This left Shah Jahan \\ndevastated who then decided to build the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his \\nwife. After many years of planning, hard work and immense sacrifices, the monument, which came \\nto be known as the Taj Mahal was bu ilt.Today people from different parts of the world travel to \\nIndia just to see this amazing white colored edifice which is also one of the most visited tourist \\ndestinations of India. Taj Mahal continues to beone of the Seven Wonders of the World!  \\nObjectives of the Study: \\nThis study is trying to explore a period that existed about five hundred years ago. The objectives of \\nsuch studies that are done in relation to a period that existed long ago are to identify the mistakes of \\nthat era and understand the conse quences of those mistakes. This would help in not repeating those \\nmistakes today, prompt and easy identification of those mistakes (if they are by chance being \\nrepeated) and also in the rectification of those mistakes.This particular research is exploring the \\nreign of Emperor Shah Jahan and trying to reach the conclusion about if that period can be called the \\ngolden era of Indian history or not. From that view point it can be said that the objective of this study \\nis to evaluate Emperor Shah Jahan and his reign, to measure the effectiveness of his policies regarding \\nrunning of an Empire that had a Muslim ruler and more than eighty percent of Hindu subjects.  \\nResearch Objectives: \\nEvery research needs to have some research objectives which are to be fulfilled by  the end of the \\nresearch. A research without any objective is like an undetermined path and is likely to not reach \\nanywhere. This research is also not an exception to this norm.

It was about \\nexploring if the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan can be called the golden era or not. For this purpose \\nsome research objectives were framed. Then research questions were deducted from these research \\nobjectives. Adequate data was collected and the research questions were answered in a tabular form \\nin the chapter on analysis and interpretations to show the linkage between the data collected, \\nanalysis done on the basis of that data and interpretations of the analysis tha t framed the answers of'),\n",
